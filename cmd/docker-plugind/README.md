# Go Docker VIM Driver plugin
`docker-plugind` is a VIM Driver Plugin that enables OpenBaton to use Docker through a [docker-popd daemon][docker-popd].

This plugin is still in its very early phase, and can only spawn and close single containers at the moment. 

## How to install `docker-plugind`
`docker-plugind` can be built using `go`, with 

```shell
go get -u github.com/mcilloni/openbaton-docker/cmd/docker-plugind
```

This will fetch and build the source and its dependencies, creating a `docker-plugind` in the `bin` directory of your _GOPATH_.

## How to launch the Docker plugin

```shell
docker-plugind --log "logfile" "name" "rabbit host" "port" "# of workers to be spawned" "username" "password"
```

If `--log` is omitted, the plugin will log on `/var/log/openbaton/type-plugin.log` on *NIX and in the Event Logger on Windows.
Use `--log -` to log only on `stdout`.

An empty command line is equivalent with the invocation below:

```shell
docker-plugind --log "-" openbaton localhost 5672 10 admin openbaton
```

## How to use the Docker plugin

After launching the plugin (see above) and [docker-popd][docker-popd], use a VIM instance JSON descriptor similar to this:

```json
{
  "name":"docker-pop-vim-instance",
  "authUrl":"http://localhost:60000",
  "tenant":"tenantName",
  "username":"user_name",
  "password":"password_value",
  "keyPair":"keyName",
  "securityGroups": [
    "securityName"
  ],
  "type":"docker-pop",
  "location":{
    "name":"Berlin",
    "latitude":"52.525876",
    "longitude":"13.314400"
  }
}
```

## How to use `thunks` to make a Jar

OpenBaton expects its plugins to be contained in `.jar` files. If you wish to autolaunch this plugin together with the NFVO, install [thunks] using go, and then invoke

```shell
# set the environment variable GOOS = linux
go build github.com/mcilloni/openbaton-docker/cmd/docker-plugind
thunks docker-plugind
``` 

This will create a self extracting Jar named _docker-plugind.jar_ that will extract and launch the VimDriver, executing it with the arguments provided by the NFVO.

## What is Open Baton?

Open Baton is an open source project providing a comprehensive implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO) specification and the TOSCA Standard.

Open Baton provides multiple mechanisms for interoperating with different VNFM vendor solutions. It has a modular architecture which can be easily extended for supporting additional use cases. 

It integrates with OpenStack as standard de-facto VIM implementation, and provides a driver mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It supports Network Service management either using the provided Generic VNFM and Juju VNFM, or integrating additional specific VNFMs. It provides several mechanisms (REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with external VNFMs. 

It can be combined with additional components (Monitoring, Fault Management, Autoscaling, and Network Slicing Engine) for building a unique MANO comprehensive solution.
